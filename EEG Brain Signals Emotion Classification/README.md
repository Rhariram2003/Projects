# EEG Brain Signals Emotion Classification using GRU

## Description:
This project explores the classification of emotions using EEG brain signals, employing a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network. The GRU model is trained on labeled EEG data to predict emotional states based on brain activity patterns. This repository includes the implementation of the GRU model, data preprocessing scripts, and evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance. Additionally, detailed documentation and instructions for replicating the experiment are provided to facilitate further research in the field of affective computing and neurotechnology.

## Introduction
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in understanding human emotions through physiological signals, particularly EEG (electroencephalography) brain signals. EEG signals offer a non-invasive means of capturing neural activity and have shown promise in decoding various cognitive processes, including emotion recognition. This project explores the use of EEG signals for emotion classification, leveraging the power of deep learning techniques, specifically a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network.

Emotion classification from EEG signals has significant implications across multiple domains, including affective computing, mental health monitoring, and human-computer interaction. By decoding neural correlates of emotions, we can gain insights into individuals' affective states, which can inform personalized interventions and enhance user experiences in various applications.

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust and accurate model for classifying emotions from EEG signals. We aim to address challenges such as the high-dimensional and noisy nature of EEG data, as well as the variability in individual responses to emotional stimuli. Through the implementation of state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, we strive to achieve superior performance in emotion classification, paving the way for advancements in affective computing research.

This repository provides a comprehensive framework for EEG-based emotion classification, including data preprocessing, model implementation, training procedures, and evaluation metrics. By open-sourcing our code and sharing our findings, we aim to facilitate collaboration and accelerate progress in the field of neurotechnology and affective computing.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Kaggle (provide the link to the Kaggle dataset if available)
- **Size**: The dataset comprises [2132] samples, with each sample containing EEG recordings and associated emotion labels.
- **Features**: EEG signals are typically recorded from multiple electrodes placed on the scalp, capturing electrical activity from different regions of the brain. Each EEG recording is represented as a time-series of voltage measurements.
- **Labels**: Emotion labels are provided for each sample, indicating the emotional state experienced by the participant during the EEG recording session. Common emotion categories may include positive, negative and neutral.
